    "This project analyzes U.S. data-related job listings from 2020, aiming to understand the factors that influence salary levels in the data science job market. Using a dataset collected from Glassdoor and enriched with cost of living estimates, the goal is to extract actionable insights on how different job characteristics, company attributes, and geographic regions impact salary outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This information can be especially valuable for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Job seekers**, who want to understand what affects salary offers and which roles or skills are most lucrative.\n",
    "- **Recruiters and HR teams**, interested in benchmarking compensation based on job type and technical requirements.\n",
    "- **Policy makers and workforce analysts**, exploring trends in tech labor markets across U.S. regions.\n",

    "\n",
    "### a. Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average salary across all listings**: **$101.5K**\n",
    "- **Highest-paying role**: *Data Scientist* (**$115.8K** average)\n",

    "### b. Tools and Technical Skills\n",
    "\n",
    "- Listings mentioning tools like **Scikit-learn**, **Keras**, **TensorFlow**, **Spark**, and **AWS** were associated with salary premiums of **$10K–$20K** above average\n",

    "- Tool indicators were consolidated into grouped binary variables (e.g., *Python_Tools_Knowledge*, *Cloud_or_BigData_Knowledge*) to improve model interpretability\n",
